# SQLAlchemy Work

The notebook and app provided demonstrate usage of both SQLAlchemy for querying and Flask to set up a rudimentary API to pull the same data. The data was provided by my class for a homework assignment and the parameters of the various pulls and API paths were as a result of the parameters of that assignment.

The Jupyter Notebook demonstrates said usage above and adds some basic visualizations of the data pulled from the SQLlite database in resources. 

As for the app, run the code, then follow the instructions to query the "API".
